Task 5
Ryan Babcock
CSCD 524: Adv Software Engineering

This code is taken from my advanced software engineering class. The map was already laid out, and our assignment was to program the cars to drive around the track while recording any instance of collisions, as well as data relevant to the check points (waypoints). 

To compile code:
	javac *.java

To run:
	java RacetrackViewerTest

To edit parameters:
	Inside the RacetrackViewerTest.java file, there is a static RacecarController instance at the top, whose parameters can be changed here (which will apply to all the racecars). Inside the runTest method, the variables "numberOfCars" and "numberOfRuns" can also be altered (numberOfCars can't go above ten!).
